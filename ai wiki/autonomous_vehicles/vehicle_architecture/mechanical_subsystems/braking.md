#### Braking (ABS, regenerative)

Braking systems in electric vehicles combine conventional hydraulic friction brakes with regenerative braking to recover kinetic energy and extend range.

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Brake Pedal / Interface** | Driver input; also provides force sensor data for autonomous control. | Force‑sensing resistors, digital signal conditioning. |
| **Anti‑Lock Braking System (ABS)** | Prevents wheel lock during high deceleration. | Hydraulic valves, wheel speed sensors, rapid pressure modulation. |
| **Regenerative Braking Controller** | Converts kinetic energy back to electrical energy via the motor inverter. | Modulates motor torque in braking mode; interacts with battery management. |
| **Brake‑by‑Wire System** | Eliminates mechanical linkage between pedal and brakes. | Servo motors or hydraulic actuators driven by electronic commands. |

#### Braking Dynamics

- **Regenerative vs Friction Brake Balance**:  
  - *Low speed*: Regeneration limited due to low motor torque; friction brakes dominate.  
  - *High speed / emergency*: Full regenerative braking may be unsafe; ABS ensures wheel control.
- **Brake Torque Vectoring**: Adjusts individual wheel torque for stability and lane‑keeping.

#### Control Architecture

1. **High‑Level Decision Module** → Desired deceleration profile.  
2. **Low‑Level Brake Controller** → Allocates force between regenerative inverter and friction brakes.  
3. **ABS Subsystem** → Monitors wheel slip, adjusts hydraulic pressure in real time (typically 10–15 Hz).  

#### Safety & Standards

- **ISO 26262**: ABS safety requirements (ASIL C/D).  
- **UNECE Regulation 5**: Braking system performance and durability.  
- **SAE J1772 / IEC 62196**: Compatibility with DC fast charging to manage battery state during heavy braking.

#### Emerging Trends

1. **Active Brake‑by‑Wire** – Full electronic control of brake pressure, enabling seamless integration with autonomous driving logic.  
2. **Dual‑Mode Regeneration** – Combines motor‑based and flywheel energy recovery for higher efficiency.  
3. **Machine Learning‑Based Deceleration Prediction** – Anticipates optimal braking curves using sensor fusion (LiDAR, camera, map data).
