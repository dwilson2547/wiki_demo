**Edge‑to‑Cloud Data Pipelines**

The edge‑to‑cloud pipeline is the communication backbone that connects on‑board compute, vehicle sensors, and infrastructure services. It supports real‑time telemetry, model updates, fleet analytics, and V2X interactions while meeting stringent latency, bandwidth, and security requirements.

| Layer | Key Technologies | Typical Use Cases |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Vehicle Edge** | 5G NR (Sub‑6 GHz / mmWave), Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC/C‑V2X), Wi‑Fi 6E, Ethernet 100 Gbps | Real‑time sensor fusion, V2X messaging, OTA firmware updates |
| **Edge Server / Roadside Unit (RSU)** | Low‑latency compute clusters, edge caching, local analytics | Local trajectory prediction, congestion management |
| **Cloud Platform** | Kubernetes, TensorFlow Serving, BigQuery, MLflow | Model training, fleet telemetry aggregation, policy enforcement |

### Communication Protocols

- **C‑V2X (5G NR V2X)** – Low‑latency (< 10 ms) broadcast of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs).  
- **DSRC (802.11p)** – Legacy 6‑Mbps channel for safety messaging in congested urban areas.  
- **Ethernet / CAN‑FD** – High‑bandwidth, deterministic data links between ECUs and the central compute cluster.

### Data Flow Architecture

```
[Sensor Modules] → [On‑board Compute (CPU/GPU/ASIC)] 
          │                                 │
          ├─> [Local Buffer / Cache]        ├─> [Edge Server]
          │                                 │
          └─> [Secure Tunnel] → [Cloud Platform]
```

- **Data Prioritization** – Safety‑critical telemetry (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) is transmitted first; non‑critical logs are batched.  
- **Compression & Encoding** – H.264/H.265 for video, LIDAR compression (Octree, voxel hashing).  
- **Time Synchronization** – PTP (Precision Time Protocol) or IEEE 1588 to align timestamps across sensors and servers.

### Security & Privacy

- **End‑to‑End Encryption** – TLS 1.3 or DTLS for V2X, AES‑GCM for data at rest.  
- **Hardware Root of Trust** – Secure Boot, TPM 2.0 on edge devices.  
- **Privacy‑Preserving Analytics** – Federated learning frameworks that keep raw sensor data on the vehicle.

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Latency (Edge‑to‑Cloud)** | < 100 ms for telemetry; < 10 ms for safety V2X. |
| **Bandwidth** | 1–5 Gbps per vehicle during peak sensor streaming. |
| **Availability** | 99.999% uptime for critical services; graceful degradation for non‑critical updates. |

### Integration with Autonomous Stack

- **Model Deployment Pipeline** – CI/CD orchestrated by tools like ArgoCD or Spinnaker, with automated rollback on failure.  
- **Data Lake** – Raw sensor feeds ingested into cloud storage (S3/Blob) and processed by Spark/Beam for downstream analytics.  
- **Fleet‑Level Optimization** – Central servers compute optimal routing, charging schedules, and software version rollout.

### Standards & Regulations

- SAE J3061 – Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS).  
- ETSI TS 102 792 – V2X communication security requirements.  
- ISO/IEC 27001 – Information security management for data pipelines.
