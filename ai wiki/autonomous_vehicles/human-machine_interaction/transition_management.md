**Transition Management (Manual ↔ Autonomous)**  

*Purpose*: Seamlessly manage hand‑over and takeover scenarios between human drivers and autonomous control systems, ensuring safety, usability, and legal compliance.

| Stage | Key Processes |
|-------|---------------|
| **Preparation** | Driver verification (e.g., biometric check), confirmation of vehicle readiness (sensors online, software health). |
| **Hand‑Over to Autonomous** | • Driver releases steering wheel or presses “Autonomous” button.<br>• System checks driver state (DMS) for alertness. <br>• Vehicle enters autonomous mode; HUD displays status and autonomy level. |
| **Takeover Request** | • Driver initiates manual control via steering, accelerator/brake.<br>• System detects takeover intent through sensor fusion of wheel torque, pedal input, or voice command. |
| **Transition Execution** | • Autonomous controller gradually cedes authority: reduces speed, opens lane for driver maneuvering.<br>• Provide haptic feedback on wheel to guide driver if needed. |
| **Fail‑Safe & Rollback** | If autonomous system detects fault or critical event, it may trigger a safe state (e.g., gentle braking) and alert the driver. |
| **Feedback Loop** | Post‑transition data (time taken, driver actions) used to refine transition algorithms. |

*Algorithms & Models*  
- **Takeover Prediction**: Bayesian network combining wheel torque, steering angle velocity, and driver gaze to estimate takeover probability.  
- **Transition Planning**: Model Predictive Control (MPC) that blends autonomous trajectory with driver‑initiated path, ensuring lateral stability.  

*Regulatory Considerations*  
- UNECE Regulation No. 57 requires safe hand‑over procedures.  
- ISO 26262 mandates validation of takeover logic for ASIL D components.  

*Human Factors Research*  
- Studies on optimal takeover latency (<2 s).  
- Impact of driver fatigue on takeover performance.  
- UI cues (color changes, audible alerts) that reduce confusion.
