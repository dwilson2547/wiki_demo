**Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS)**  

*Purpose*: Continuously assess the driver’s state—attention, fatigue, distraction, and physiological condition—to ensure safe hand‑over or takeover of vehicle control.  

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Vision‑Based Sensors** | High‑definition cameras mounted on the dashboard capture facial features, eye gaze, head pose, and eyelid closure (blink rate). 3‑D depth sensors or infrared can improve robustness in low light. |
| **Physiological Monitoring** | Optional integration of ECG, skin conductance, or pulse oximetry sensors embedded in seatbelts or steering wheels to detect arousal or stress levels. |
| **Machine Learning Models** | Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for face‑pose estimation; Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Temporal CNNs for fatigue detection; Attention‑based models for gaze direction inference. |
| **Decision Logic** | Rule‑based thresholds (e.g., PERCLOS > 0.5 % → alert) combined with probabilistic risk scores to trigger escalating alerts: visual, auditory, haptic, and finally autonomous takeover if driver fails to respond. |
| **Data Handling & Privacy** | On‑board processing minimizes data transmission; anonymized face embeddings are stored locally for compliance with GDPR/CCPA. |
| **Regulatory Landscape** | ISO 26262 (ASIL D) covers functional safety of monitoring logic. UNECE Regulation No. 57 mandates driver state monitoring in certain markets. |

*Implementation Flow*  
1. Capture video frame → preprocess (face detection, alignment).  
2. Extract features → feed into fatigue & distraction classifiers.  
3. Generate risk score → compare against threshold.  
4. Trigger alert hierarchy or hand‑over to autonomous mode.

*Challenges & Research Directions*  
- Robustness across diverse lighting and facial characteristics.  
- Real‑time inference on low‑power edge hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson).  
- Integration with other vehicle subsystems for coordinated decision making.
