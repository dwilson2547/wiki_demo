# Machine Learning Policies for Behavioral Planning  

**Goal** – Provide a comprehensive guide to designing, training, and deploying data‑driven behavioral planners that can learn complex driving strategies from experience.

## 1. ML Paradigms in Behavioral Planning  

| Paradigm | Core Idea | Typical Algorithms |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Imitation Learning (IL)** | Learn policy π(a|s) by mimicking expert demonstrations. | Behavioral cloning, DAGGER, Inverse RL. |
| **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** | Optimize expected cumulative reward R = Σγⁿrₙ via interaction with environment. | PPO, DDPG, SAC, TD3. |
| **Hybrid IL + RL** | Start from expert data, then fine‑tune with exploration. | Guided Policy Search, ALVINN+RL. |

## 2. Training Pipeline  

1. **Data Collection**  
   *Simulation:* CARLA, LGSVL, PreScan.  
   *Real‑world:* Waymo Open Dataset, nuScenes.  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   *Sensor fusion*: Align lidar, radar, camera streams.  
   *State representation*: 3D occupancy grids, bird’s‑eye view images, or raw point clouds.  
3. **Model Architecture**  
   *Encoder:* CNN/LSTM for visual input; PointNet/GraphNN for point clouds.  
   *Policy head:* MLP outputting continuous controls (steer, throttle, brake).  
4. **Loss Functions**  
   *IL*: Cross‑entropy or mean squared error between predicted and expert actions.  
   *RL*: Policy gradient loss + entropy regularization.  
5. **Safety Constraints Integration**  
   *Reward shaping:* Penalize unsafe states heavily.  
   *Projection layer:* Clamp outputs to feasible control limits.

## 3. Safety‑First Design  

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO)** | Optimize policy while satisfying safety constraints expressed as expected cost ≤ threshold. |
| **Shielding** | Runtime monitor that overrides unsafe actions before execution. |
| **Risk‑Aware RL** | Include probabilistic risk estimates in reward function (e.g., collision probability). |

## 4. Explainability & Verification  

* **Feature Attribution:** Grad‑CAM, SHAP values to identify which inputs influenced a decision.  
* **Formal Abstraction:** Map high‑dimensional neural policy to finite‑state machine via clustering; then apply model checking.  
* **Testing Suites:** Generate adversarial scenarios (e.g., sudden pedestrian appearance) and evaluate robustness.

## 5. Deployment Considerations  

1. **Real‑time Constraints** – Ensure inference latency < 10 ms on target hardware (NVIDIA DRIVE AGX, Qualcomm Snapdragon).  
2. **Edge vs Cloud** – Run lightweight policy locally; offload heavy computation or model updates to cloud.  
3. **Over‑the‑Air Updates** – Secure OTA mechanisms with code signing and rollback capabilities.

## 6. Case Study: End‑to‑End Driving Policy  

*Input:*  
- Front camera image (RGB)  
- Lidar point cloud (downsampled)  
- Ego vehicle speed & heading

*Output:*  
- Steering angle ∈ [−1, +1]  
- Acceleration ∈ [−1, +1]

*Training:*  
- Pre‑train on simulated data for 10⁶ steps.  
- Fine‑tune with human‑labelled real‑world trajectories (5k hours).  

*Safety Layer:*  
- Collision risk estimator running in parallel; triggers emergency brake if probability > 0.02.
