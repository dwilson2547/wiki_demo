# Behavioral Planning in Autonomous Vehicles  

**Overview**  
Behavioral planning is the layer of an autonomous vehicle’s control stack that determines *what* a vehicle should do next (e.g., lane change, yield, overtake) given its current context and high‑level objectives. It sits between route generation and low‑level motion planning, translating traffic rules, environmental perception, and mission goals into concrete actions.

## 1. Functional Role  
| Sub‑function | Responsibility |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Situation Assessment** | Interpret sensor data & map information to create a situational model (other agents, road geometry, constraints). |
| **Decision Logic** | Select an appropriate behavior from a policy set while respecting legal and safety requirements. |
| **Action Sequencing** | Generate a temporally coherent sequence of high‑level maneuvers. |
| **Interaction Handling** | Resolve conflicts with other road users (e.g., yielding, cooperative merging). |

---

## 2. Rule‑Based Policies  

Rule‑based behavioral planners encode explicit logic in the form of if–then statements, finite state machines, or decision trees.

### 2.1 Advantages  
* **Transparency & Explainability** – Every action can be traced to a rule.  
* **Deterministic Guarantees** – Easier to verify and certify under safety standards.  
* **Low Computational Load** – Simple evaluations suitable for embedded hardware.  

### 2.2 Common Rule‑Based Architectures  

| Architecture | Key Features |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Finite State Machine (FSM)** | Discrete states such as “Cruise”, “LaneChange”, “Stop”. Transitions triggered by sensor thresholds or higher‑level goals. |
| **Behavior Tree** | Hierarchical tree of tasks; enables modularity and reusability. Nodes can be composed for complex behaviors (e.g., merge into lane while obeying speed limit). |
| **Rule Tables / Decision Tables** | Structured representation of conditions → actions, often generated from legal specifications. |

### 2.3 Rule‑Based Implementation Example  

```pseudo
IF traffic_light == RED AND distance_to_light < 10m:
    STOP()
ELSE IF lane_change_requested:
    IF adjacent_lane_clear():
        LANE_CHANGE_LEFT()
    ELSE:
        WAIT_FOR_CLEARANCE()
ELSE:
    MAINTAIN_SPEED(target_speed)
```

### 2.4 Limitations  
* **Scalability** – Hard to maintain as rule set grows; combinatorial explosion of edge cases.  
* **Adaptivity** – Rigid logic may fail in novel or ambiguous situations.  
* **Inter‑vehicle Coordination** – Rules do not inherently model cooperation beyond simple handshakes.

## 3. Machine Learning (ML) Policies  

ML‑based planners learn policies directly from data, often using reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning (IL), or supervised learning on annotated scenarios.

### 3.1 Paradigms  

| Paradigm | Typical Approach | Strengths |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Imitation Learning** | Train a policy to mimic expert driving demonstrations (e.g., DAgger, behavioral cloning). | Fast convergence; leverages existing data. |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learn via reward signals in simulation or real‑world trials (e.g., PPO, DQN). | Handles long‑term planning; explores novel strategies. |
| **End‑to‑End Deep Networks** | Map sensor inputs directly to steering/brake commands. | Minimal hand‑crafted features. |

### 3.2 Training Data & Environments  

* **Simulation Platforms** – CARLA, LGSVL, PreScan for large‑scale scenario generation.  
* **Real‑World Datasets** – Waymo Open Dataset, nuScenes, Argoverse.  
* **Hybrid Approaches** – Combine simulation pre‑training with fine‑tuning on real data.

### 3.3 Safety & Reliability Considerations  

| Issue | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|
| **Distribution Shift** | Domain randomization; continual learning pipelines. |
| **Explainability** | Post‑hoc interpretability (saliency maps, counterfactuals). |
| **Formal Verification** | Model checking of learned policies via abstraction or reachability analysis. |

### 3.4 Example Architecture  

```
Sensor Fusion Module → Feature Encoder (CNN/LSTM) → Policy Network (MLP)
                                          ↓
                                 Action Output (steer, accelerate, brake)
```

## 4. Ethical Decision Modules  

Behavioral planners must sometimes resolve conflicts between safety, legality, and ethical values.

### 4.1 Moral Dilemmas in AVs  
* **Trolley‑Problem Variants** – Choosing between harming a pedestrian or the vehicle’s occupants.  
* **Prioritization of Stakeholders** – Balancing passenger comfort vs. public safety.  

### 4.2 Frameworks for Ethical Decision Making  

| Framework | Core Idea |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Utilitarian Cost Models** | Minimize expected harm using probabilistic risk estimates. |
| **Rule‑Based Ethics Engine** | Encode societal norms as hard constraints (e.g., never hit a child). |
| **Learning‑based Preference Aggregation** | Infer acceptable trade‑offs from human feedback or crowd‑sourced judgments. |

### 4.3 Implementation Example  

```pseudo
risk_pedestrian = compute_collision_probability(pedestrian)
risk_occupant   = compute_collision_probability(occupants)

IF risk_pedestrian + weight * risk_occupant < safety_threshold:
    PROCEED()
ELSE:
    EMERGENCY_BRAKE()
```

*`weight` is tuned to reflect ethical priorities.*

### 4.4 Regulatory & Societal Impact  

* **Transparency Requirements** – Auditable logs of decision rationale.  
* **Public Trust** – Aligning vehicle behavior with societal expectations through participatory design.

## 5. Integration into the AV Stack  

1. **Perception → Situation Model** (object detection, trajectory prediction).  
2. **Behavior Planner** consumes situation model + mission goal to output high‑level intent.  
3. **Motion Planner** translates intent into a continuous trajectory respecting kinematic constraints.  
4. **Control Layer** executes trajectory via actuators.

---

## 6. Current Research Directions  

* Hybrid rule/ML systems that combine explainable safety envelopes with learned adaptability.  
* Real‑time ethical reasoning modules integrated with risk assessment engines.  
* Cross‑vehicle cooperative behavior learning using multi‑agent reinforcement learning.
