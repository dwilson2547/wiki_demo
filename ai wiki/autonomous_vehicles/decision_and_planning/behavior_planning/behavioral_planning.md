# Behavioral Planning in Autonomous Vehicles  

**Overview**  
Behavioral planning is the intermediate layer between high‑level route generation and low‑level motion control. It determines *what* an autonomous vehicle should do in a given context (e.g., lane change, yielding, merging) rather than how it will physically execute the maneuver. This page introduces the core concepts, design trade‑offs, and key algorithms that underpin behavioral planning.

## 1. Functional Role  

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Intent Generation** | Translate high‑level goals (e.g., “reach destination”) into actionable intents (“overtake vehicle X”). |
| **Rule Compliance** | Ensure all actions obey traffic laws, road geometry, and local regulations. |
| **Interaction Modeling** | Predict and respond to the behaviors of surrounding agents (cars, pedestrians, cyclists). |
| **Risk Assessment** | Evaluate safety margins before committing to an action. |
| **Ethical Reasoning** | Resolve conflicts between competing objectives (e.g., passenger comfort vs. pedestrian safety). |

## 2. Design Approaches  

### 2.1 Rule‑Based Systems  
*Traditional expert systems that encode traffic rules and heuristics.*

- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**  
  * States represent discrete driving contexts (e.g., “following”, “overtaking”). Transitions are triggered by sensor events or high‑level commands.

- **Behavior Trees**  
  * Hierarchical composition of tasks; allows parallel execution and easy debugging.

- **Pros & Cons**  

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Predictable, verifiable behavior | Limited adaptability to novel situations |
| Straightforward implementation | Requires exhaustive rule coverage |
| Easier regulatory compliance | Difficult to integrate learning components |

### 2.2 Machine‑Learning (ML) Policies  
*Data‑driven approaches that learn policies from simulation or real‑world driving data.*

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**  
  * Policy π(s) maps state s to action a, optimized via reward functions that encode safety, efficiency, and comfort.

- **Imitation Learning**  
  * Supervised training on human driver trajectories; variants include Behavioral Cloning and Inverse RL.

- **Hybrid Models**  
  * Combine rule‑based constraints with learned decision modules (e.g., “safe set” enforcement).

- **Pros & Cons**  

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Handles high‑dimensional, continuous inputs | Requires large amounts of safe training data |
| Adaptable to complex scenarios | Harder to formally verify safety properties |
| Can discover novel strategies | Potential for unintended behavior if reward mis‑specified |

## 3. Key Algorithms  

1. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**  
   * Discrete state/action formulation; solved via dynamic programming or value iteration.

2. **Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)**  
   * Incorporates uncertainty in perception; belief‑state planning using particle filters or grid methods.

3. **Deterministic Planning with Constraints**  
   * Linear/convex optimization over discrete action sets subject to safety constraints.

4. **Trajectory Sampling & Scoring**  
   * Generate candidate behavioral trajectories (e.g., lane change, merge) and evaluate using a cost function that includes collision risk, comfort, and rule compliance.

## 4. Safety & Verification  

- **Formal Methods**  
  * Model checking of FSMs/Behavior Trees against safety specifications.
- **Runtime Monitoring**  
  * Runtime verification to detect policy violations in real time.
- **Redundancy**  
  * Dual‑policy architecture: a rule‑based backup that overrides ML decisions when risk thresholds are exceeded.

## 5. Ethical Decision Modules  

When multiple valid actions exist, ethical reasoning helps resolve conflicts (e.g., passenger vs pedestrian safety). Common frameworks:

| Framework | Core Idea |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Utilitarian** | Choose action minimizing expected harm to the greatest number of people. |
| **Deontological** | Enforce hard constraints (“never hit a pedestrian”) regardless of outcomes. |
| **Virtue Ethics** | Adopt a style of driving that reflects societal values (e.g., courteous, prudent). |

Implementation typically involves:

1. **Scenario Encoding** – Define conflict scenarios and stakeholder priorities.
2. **Utility Functions** – Quantify harm to each party (e.g., expected injury severity).
3. **Decision Rule** – Select action with highest ethical utility or that satisfies hard constraints.

## 7. Future Directions  

- **Explainable AI** – Making ML decisions interpretable to regulators and passengers.  
- **Multi‑Agent Coordination** – Decentralized behavioral planning for platooning or intersection management.  
- **Continual Learning** – Online adaptation while guaranteeing safety.
