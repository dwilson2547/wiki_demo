# Rule‑Based Policies for Behavioral Planning  

**Purpose** – Outline the design, implementation, and validation of deterministic behavioral planners that rely on explicit rules derived from traffic laws, safety constraints, and operational logic.

---

## 1. Design Principles  

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Modularity** | Separate concerns (lane keeping, merging, yielding) into distinct components or sub‑states. |
| **Determinism** | Each rule execution path is fully deterministic; no stochastic elements unless explicitly modeled. |
| **Simplicity** | Keep the rule set as small as possible while covering required scenarios to ease verification. |
| **Prioritization** | Assign priority levels to rules (e.g., emergency stop > lane change) to resolve conflicts. |

## 2. Common Rule‑Based Structures  

### 2.1 Finite State Machine (FSM)

*States:*  
- `Cruise`  
- `LaneChangeLeft/Right`  
- `Yield`  
- `Stop`  
- `EmergencyBrake`

*Transitions:* Triggered by sensor inputs or higher‑level commands.

**Example Transition Logic**

```
State = Cruise
IF obstacle_detected AND distance < safe_stop_distance:
    State ← Stop
ELSE IF lane_change_requested:
    IF adjacent_lane_clear():
        State ← LaneChangeLeft
```

### 2.2 Behavior Tree

*Root Node:* `Selector`  
- **Sequence**: `CheckTrafficLights → StopIfRed`  
- **Sequence**: `CheckLaneClearance → ChangeLane`  

Behavior trees allow concurrent monitoring of multiple conditions and graceful fallback.

### 2.3 Decision Tables

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Traffic light = RED & distance < 10m | STOP() |
| Lane change requested & adjacent lane clear | LANE_CHANGE_LEFT() |
| Speed > speed limit | DECELERATE() |

Decision tables are often derived from legal specifications and can be auto‑generated into code.

## 3. Implementation Tips  

1. **State Encoding** – Use bit flags or enums for efficient state checks on embedded hardware.  
2. **Rule Ordering** – Place high‑priority rules (e.g., collision avoidance) at the top of evaluation stacks.  
3. **Temporal Constraints** – Incorporate timers to prevent oscillations (e.g., a lane change must complete within 5 s).  
4. **Fallback Mechanisms** – Define safe defaults if no rule applies (typically “maintain current behavior”).

## 4. Validation & Verification  

| Technique | What It Covers |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Formal Model Checking** | Exhaustively explores state space of FSM to prove safety properties. |
| **Simulation Testing** | Runs thousands of scenarios in a high‑fidelity simulator (e.g., CARLA). |
| **Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)** | Tests rule execution on actual vehicle electronics with synthetic inputs. |
| **Test Coverage Analysis** | Ensures every rule and transition is exercised by test cases. |

## 5. Limitations & Mitigation  

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Rule Explosion** | Hard to maintain; difficult to cover edge cases. | Modularize rules, use hierarchical trees, adopt rule generation tools from legal specs. |
| **Lack of Adaptivity** | May fail in unforeseen scenarios. | Combine with ML fallback policies or safety‑critical overrides that trigger when uncertainty exceeds thresholds. |
| **Human Interpretability vs Complexity** | Complex rule sets become opaque. | Keep rule set lean; provide human‑readable documentation and visualization tools. |

## 6. Use Cases  

*Urban driving:*  
- Stop at red lights, yield to pedestrians, obey speed limits.  

*Highway driving:*  
- Merge into lane only if gap > threshold, maintain safe following distance.

*Emergency situations:*  
- Detect imminent collision → immediate emergency brake irrespective of current state.
