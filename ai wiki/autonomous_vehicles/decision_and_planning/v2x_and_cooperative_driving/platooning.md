# Platooning  

Platooning is a cooperative driving technique where multiple vehicles travel in close formation, maintaining small inter‑vehicle gaps to improve fuel efficiency, traffic flow, and safety. It relies heavily on V2V communication for real‑time coordination.

## 1. Basic Concept  

- **Leader**: Vehicle at the front sets speed, acceleration, lane changes.  
- **Followers**: Vehicles behind adjust their motion based on leader’s state and relative distance to predecessor.

### Key Metrics  

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Inter‑vehicle gap | 2–5 m (depends on vehicle type) |
| Fuel savings | 10–15 % for heavy trucks, 4–7 % for passenger cars |
| Lane occupancy | Reduced by ~30 % |

## 2. Control Architecture  

1. **Sensing**  
   - Onboard radar/lidar provides relative position of immediate predecessor.  
   - V2V messages deliver *long‑range* leader data.

2. **State Estimation**  
   - Kalman Filter fusing sensor and message data to estimate true distance, velocity, acceleration.

3. **Trajectory Generation**  
   - Model Predictive Control (MPC) solves for optimal speed profile that respects safety constraints and desired gap.  

4. **Actuation**  
   - ACC subsystem applies throttle/brake commands; lane‑keeping system handles lateral control.

## 3. Communication Protocols  

- **DSRC or C‑V2X** broadcasts BSM every 100 ms.  
- **Message Content**: Speed, acceleration, lane position, intent (e.g., lane change).  

### Message Latency Requirements  

| Requirement | Typical Value |
|-------------|---------------|
| End‑to‑end latency | <10 ms (DSRC) / <20 ms (C‑V2X direct mode) |
| Packet loss rate | <1 % |

## 4. Safety & Redundancy  

- **Fail‑Safe Modes**: If communication is lost, followers revert to conventional adaptive cruise control with larger gaps.  
- **Redundant Sensors**: Radar + camera fusion reduces reliance on V2V data alone.

## 5. Platoon Management  

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Formation Control** | Determining number of vehicles and gap configuration. |
| **Entry/Exit Protocols** | Safe merging into/out of platoons via V2X negotiation. |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Handling sudden stops, obstacles; coordinated braking to avoid cascading collisions. |

## 6. Regulatory & Legal Considerations  

- **Liability**: Determining fault in case of platoon collision (lead vs follower).  
- **Roadway Design**: Signage indicating platooning lanes or priority rights.  
- **Certification**: SAE J3016 Level 3/4 autonomous standards extended to platooning scenarios.

## 7. Real‑World Deployments  

| Company | Project | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Volvo Trucks | Truck Platooning Demo | Commercial trials in Sweden, US. |
| Waymo | Autonomous truck platoon | Pilot in California. |
| Tesla | “Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control” (pilot) | Limited to 2‑vehicle formation. |

## 8. Future Research Directions  

- **Heterogeneous Platoons**: Mixing vehicles of different sizes and capabilities.  
- **Intersection Coordination**: Integrating platoon control with intersection management for zero‑stop crossing.  
- **Cybersecurity**: Designing robust authentication schemes to prevent malicious takeover of platoon leader.
