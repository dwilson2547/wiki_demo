# High‑Level Route Planning in Autonomous Vehicles  

**Overview**  
High‑level route planning is the process of determining a feasible, efficient, and safe path from an origin to a destination before any low‑level motion control occurs. It operates at a coarser spatial resolution than trajectory generation, typically using high‑definition (HD) maps and real‑time traffic data.  

**Key Functions**

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| **Map Query & Selection** | Identify candidate routes through a graph of road segments. |
| **Cost Evaluation** | Compute route cost based on travel time, distance, energy consumption, and policy constraints (e.g., toll avoidance). |
| **Policy‑Driven Constraints** | Enforce legal, safety, or company policies such as speed limits, lane restrictions, or no‑entry zones. |
| **Dynamic Re‑Planning Trigger** | Detect when traffic, incidents, or sensor updates warrant a new route calculation. |

**Workflow**

1. **Input Acquisition**  
   * Current vehicle pose (latitude/longitude, heading).  
   * Destination waypoint(s).  
   * Optional constraints: time windows, energy budgets.

2. **Graph Construction**  
   * HD map provides nodes (intersections, lane merges) and edges (lane‑level segments).  
   * Edge attributes include speed limits, number of lanes, turn restrictions, and dynamic weights (traffic, weather).

3. **Route Search Algorithm**  
   * A* or Dijkstra for static maps; Bi‑directional variants for faster queries.  
   * Multi‑objective optimization (time vs energy) via Pareto front search.

4. **Post‑Processing**  
   * Lane assignment: choose specific lanes on each edge, respecting turn restrictions.  
   * Generate a high‑level waypoints list for the behavior planner.

5. **Validation & Handover**  
   * Verify route feasibility with perception data (e.g., missing lane markings).  
   * Pass waypoints to motion planning module.

## HD Map Integration

HD maps provide sub‑centimeter accuracy of road geometry, lane topology, and static objects. Key integration steps:

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Map Loading** | Cache relevant map tiles based on current GPS location. |
| **Localization Alignment** | Fuse GNSS + INS with map features (e.g., landmarks) for pose refinement. |
| **Dynamic Data Overlay** | Merge live traffic feeds, incident reports, and roadwork data onto static map edges. |

## Dynamic Re‑Planning

High‑level route planning must adapt to changing conditions such as congestion, accidents, or construction.

### Triggers
- **Traffic Updates:** Sudden increase in travel time on a planned edge.
- **Incidents:** Accident reports, temporary closures.
- **Sensor Alerts:** Obstruction detected ahead that invalidates the current lane selection.
- **Policy Changes:** New regulations (e.g., temporary speed limit changes).

### Process

1. **Event Detection** – Continuous monitoring of traffic feeds and perception alerts.
2. **Re‑Evaluation** – Re-run route search with updated edge weights or removed edges.
3. **Decision Logic** – Choose between:
   * Minor detour: modify only the affected segment.
   * Full re‑route: recompute entire path if large-scale disruption.
4. **Smooth Transition** – Generate a new waypoint sequence that merges seamlessly with the current trajectory to avoid abrupt changes.

### Algorithms
- **Incremental Graph Search (D* Lite, Lifelong Planning A\*)** for efficient re‑planning when only local graph changes occur.
- **Multi‑Stage Planning**: first compute a coarse route, then refine near obstacles using hierarchical planning.

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Goal |
|---|---|
| **Computation Time** | < 50 ms for real‑time re‑planning on edge hardware. |
| **Route Optimality** | Within 5% of global optimum for time or energy. |
| **Robustness** | Successful detour in ≥95% of traffic incident scenarios. |

## Security & Privacy

- Secure transport of map updates (TLS, signed packets).  
- Anonymized sharing of vehicle telemetry to improve map quality without revealing location.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Predictive Routing** – Incorporate stochastic models of future traffic conditions.  
2. **Learning‑Based Cost Functions** – Use reinforcement learning to adapt cost weights based on driver preferences or energy budgets.  
3. **Collaborative Re‑Planning** – Share re‑route decisions among neighboring vehicles for coordinated congestion avoidance.
