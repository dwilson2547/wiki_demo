**Secure Boot & Firmware Attestation**  

**Overview**  
Secure boot and firmware attestation are foundational mechanisms that protect the integrity of an autonomous vehicle’s (AV) on‑board computing platform from tampering, supply‑chain attacks, or unauthorized modifications. These techniques ensure that only authenticated, cryptographically signed code is executed during the system’s power‑on sequence and throughout its operational life.

### 1. Secure Boot Architecture  

| Layer | Function | Key Components |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Hardware Root of Trust** | Provides an immutable foundation for verification. | Trusted Platform Module (TPM), Hardware Security Module (HSM), secure microcontroller units (MCUs) with ROM‑based keys. |
| **Bootloader Verification** | Validates the integrity and authenticity of the bootloader before execution. | Digital signatures, public‑key cryptography (RSA‑2048/ECC‑P256), hash functions (SHA‑256). |
| **OS & Kernel Validation** | Confirms that the operating system kernel and drivers have not been altered. | Signed kernel images, immutable read‑only memory sections, secure bootloader extensions. |
| **Application Verification** | Ensures that critical AV applications (e.g., perception stacks) are trustworthy. | Per‑application signing, hierarchical attestation chains, secure firmware update modules. |

### 2. Firmware Attestation  

Attestation allows remote parties (manufacturers, fleet operators, or regulatory bodies) to verify the current state of an AV’s software stack.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Measurement** | The device computes a cryptographic hash over the measured code segments. |
| **2. Quote Generation** | Using the TPM/HSM, the device signs the measurement with a private key that only it possesses. |
| **3. Verification** | The verifier checks the signature against known public keys and validates that the hash matches an approved firmware version. |
| **4. Continuous Monitoring** | Periodic attestation during operation ensures no runtime modifications (e.g., malicious DLL injection). |

### 3. Key Management & Lifecycle  

* **Key Generation** – Keys are generated in a secure, isolated environment (e.g., hardware key vault) and never leave the device unencrypted.  
* **Key Storage** – Private keys reside in non‑volatile, tamper‑resistant memory; read‑only access is enforced by the CPU’s security extensions.  
* **Key Rotation & Revocation** – Firmware updates trigger key rotation; compromised keys are revoked via a secure OTA (over‑the‑air) channel with cryptographic revocation lists.

### 4. Threat Models Addressed  

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Physical tampering of ECU modules | Tamper‑evident enclosures, hardware root of trust that aborts boot on physical breach detection. |
| Supply‑chain compromise (pre‑installed malware) | Signed firmware from a trusted manufacturer; attestation verifies chain of custody. |
| Runtime code injection or modification | Continuous attestation and integrity checks; secure memory regions prevent unauthorized writes. |

### 5. Standards & Best Practices  

* **ISO/SAE 21434** – Cybersecurity engineering for road vehicles.  
* **NIST SP‑800‑63B** – Digital identity guidelines for authentication, including firmware signing.  
* **AUTOSAR Secure Boot Specification** – Provides a modular approach to secure boot across automotive ECUs.

### 6. Implementation Roadmap  

1. **Hardware Selection** – Choose ECUs with built‑in TPM/HSM support (e.g., NXP’s i.MX 8M Plus).  
2. **Bootloader Development** – Implement cryptographic verification in the first-stage bootloader; integrate with existing automotive boot sequences.  
3. **Key Provisioning** – Securely provision device keys during manufacturing, using secure key injection mechanisms.  
4. **OTA Update System** – Build a signed, encrypted OTA pipeline that automatically updates firmware while maintaining attestation integrity.  
5. **Monitoring & Logging** – Collect attestation logs and send to fleet management servers for anomaly detection.

### 7. Future Directions  

* **Hardware‑Assisted Attestation** – Leveraging side‑channel resistant designs (e.g., ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX) for more robust protection.  
* **Post‑Quantum Signatures** – Transitioning from RSA/ECC to lattice‑based or hash‑based signatures as quantum threats mature.  
* **Edge‑to‑Cloud Secure Channels** – Integrating secure boot attestation with end‑to‑end vehicle‑cloud communication (TLS 1.3, QUIC).
