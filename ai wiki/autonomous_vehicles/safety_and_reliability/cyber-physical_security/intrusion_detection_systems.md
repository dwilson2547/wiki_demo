**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for Cyber‑Physical Vehicles**  

**Overview**  
Intrusion detection systems in autonomous vehicles monitor system behavior and network traffic to detect anomalous or malicious activity that could compromise safety, privacy, or operational integrity. IDS operates on multiple layers—physical, network, application—to provide a comprehensive security posture.

### 1. IDS Taxonomy  

| Layer | Focus | Typical Techniques |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **Physical** | Detect tampering with hardware components (ECUs, sensors). | Sensor fault detection, voltage/current anomaly monitoring, side‑channel analysis. |
| **Network** | Monitor in‑vehicle network traffic (CAN, FlexRay, Ethernet) and external communications (V2X, OTA). | Protocol conformance checks, statistical anomaly detection, signature‑based filtering. |
| **Application** | Observe behavior of software modules (perception, planning). | Runtime verification, sandboxing, dynamic taint analysis. |

### 2. Network‑Level IDS  

#### 2.1 In‑Vehicle Network Monitoring  
* **CAN Bus IDS** – Detects message injection, replay attacks, and abnormal traffic patterns.  
* **Ethernet (AVB/TSN) IDS** – Ensures time‑sensitive networking flows remain within latency bounds; flags packet loss or jitter spikes.  

#### 2.2 External Communication IDS  
* **V2X IDS** – Validates message integrity and authenticity, detects spoofed beacons or malicious routing updates.  
* **OTA IDS** – Scrutinizes firmware update packets for correct signatures and version compliance.

### 3. Application‑Level IDS  

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Runtime Behavior Monitoring** | Hook into perception modules (CNN inference engines) to log input shapes, output distributions; flag outliers that may indicate model poisoning. |
| **Sandboxing & Isolation** | Run critical safety services in isolated VMs or containers with minimal privileges; detect privilege escalation attempts. |
| **Taint Tracking** | Propagate taint tags through data pipelines; if a tainted sensor input reaches the planner, raise an alert. |

---

### 4. Physical‑Layer IDS  

* **Hardware Health Monitoring** – Continuously measure ECU temperature, power supply voltage, and clock frequency; deviations may indicate fault injection or tampering.  
* **Side‑Channel Detection** – Monitor EM emissions or power consumption to detect cryptographic key extraction attempts.

### 5. Threat Landscape & Countermeasures  

| Attack | IDS Response |
|--------|--------------|
| CAN Bus Replay / Message Injection | Statistical traffic analysis; flag repeated identical messages from the same source address. |
| V2X Spoofing | Verify digital signatures on broadcast packets; cross‑check with GPS/IMU data for consistency. |
| Firmware Rollback | Monitor firmware version numbers during boot; alert if a lower, untrusted version is detected. |
| Model Poisoning | Analyze inference confidence scores; sudden drops in classification accuracy trigger investigation. |

### 6. Integration Strategies  

1. **Hardware Acceleration** – Deploy IDS logic on dedicated ASICs or FPGAs to avoid impacting real‑time performance.  
2. **Edge‑to‑Cloud Analytics** – Aggregate IDS logs to a central fleet‑management platform for machine‑learning‑based threat detection.  
3. **Fail‑Safe Mechanisms** – On IDS trigger, the vehicle should default to a safe state (e.g., autonomous emergency braking or controlled shutdown).

### 7. Standards & Frameworks  

* **ISO/SAE 21434** – Cybersecurity risk management for automotive systems.  
* **NIST SP‑800‑61 Rev.2** – Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, adapted to vehicle environments.  
* **AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform** – Provides security services (Authentication, Encryption) that can be leveraged by IDS modules.

### 8. Deployment Roadmap  

| Phase | Milestones |
|-------|------------|
| **1. Baseline Monitoring** | Deploy passive CAN bus sniffers; log traffic patterns for normal baseline. |
| **2. Signature Development** | Create signatures for known attack vectors (e.g., message ID spoofing). |
| **3. Anomaly Engine** | Implement statistical models (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) to detect deviations from baseline. |
| **4. Incident Response Integration** | Connect IDS alerts to automated safety protocols; test safe‑state transitions. |
| **5. Continuous Learning** | Use fleet data to refine IDS thresholds and update signatures dynamically. |

### 9. Future Enhancements  

* **AI‑Driven Anomaly Detection** – Deep learning models that learn high‑dimensional traffic patterns across multi‑modal sensors.  
* **Quantum‑Resistant Cryptography** – Integrate post‑quantum signature schemes into network IDS to safeguard against future threats.  
* **Hardware‑Based Root of Trust for IDS** – Use TPM/HSM to sign IDS firmware and ensure integrity of detection logic itself.
