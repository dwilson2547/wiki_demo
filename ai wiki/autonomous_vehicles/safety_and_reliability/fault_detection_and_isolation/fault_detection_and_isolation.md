## Fault Detection & Isolation (FDI) – Autonomous Vehicles

**Scope:**  
This page provides a comprehensive overview of the Fault Detection & Isolation mechanisms used in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems to ensure safety, reliability, and resilience against hardware, software, and environmental failures. It is part of the broader *Safety & Reliability* domain within the Autonomous‑Vehicle Concept Tree.

### 1. Introduction

Faults can arise from a variety of sources:
- **Hardware degradation** (e.g., sensor drift, actuator wear)
- **Software bugs or memory corruption**
- **Communication errors** (bus faults, packet loss)
- **Environmental disturbances** (temperature spikes, electromagnetic interference)

FDI aims to detect these anomalies early and isolate the affected component(s) so that the system can either recover gracefully or transition to a safe state.

### 2. Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Fault Detection** | The process of identifying that an anomaly has occurred. |
| **Fault Isolation** | Determining which subsystem/component is responsible for the fault. |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Maintaining operation (possibly degraded) after a fault has been isolated. |

---

### 3. FDI Strategies in AVs

#### 3.1 Redundancy‑Based Detection
- **Hardware redundancy**: Duplicate sensors, processors, or power supplies.
- **Software redundancy**: Dual‑modular or triple‑modular redundant (DMR/TMR) implementations of critical algorithms.
- **Voting mechanisms**: Majority voting for sensor fusion; Byzantine fault tolerant protocols for communication.

#### 3.2 Model‑Based Detection
- **State observers**: Kalman filters, Luenberger observers that estimate expected states and flag deviations beyond thresholds.
- **Physics‑based models**: Predict vehicle dynamics; anomalies indicate possible actuator or control faults.

#### 3.3 Self‑Diagnostics & Health Monitoring
- **Built‑in self‑test (BIST)** routines for processors, memory, I/O interfaces.
- **Runtime monitoring**: Watchdog timers, stack‑usage checks, exception counters.
- **Health status reporting**: CAN‑FD health frames; diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) per ISO 15031.

### 4. Fault Isolation Techniques

| Technique | Description | Typical Use‑Case |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Cross‑checking** | Compare outputs of redundant modules; inconsistencies point to faulty module. | TMR for perception pipelines. |
| **Signal correlation analysis** | Correlate sensor data with expected behavior; outliers indicate fault location. | Lidar vs camera fusion. |
| **Time‑stamped event logging** | Trace execution timeline to pinpoint where a violation occurred. | Software stack debugging. |
| **Hardware fault injection testing** | Deliberately introduce faults in test environments to validate isolation logic. | Validation of FDI modules. |

### 5. Implementation Architecture

1. **Fault Detection Layer (FDL)**
   - Interfaces with all sensors, actuators, and communication buses.
   - Runs lightweight monitoring routines; reports anomalies.

2. **Fault Isolation Engine (FIE)**
   - Receives anomaly reports from FDL.
   - Executes isolation algorithms (cross‑check, model comparison).
   - Determines affected component(s).

3. **Fault Recovery Manager (FRM)**
   - Decides recovery strategy: switch to redundant module, execute safe mode, or notify higher‑level decision layer.

4. **Health Reporting Interface (HRI)**
   - Exposes health status over CAN‑FD or Ethernet.
   - Logs events for post‑mortem analysis.

| ISO 26262 – Functional Safety | Defines safety integrity levels (ASIL), fault detection requirements, and testing procedures. |
| SAE J3061 – Cybersecurity Guide | Addresses fault detection for security‑related anomalies. |

### 7. Testing & Validation

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify individual FDI modules (e.g., observer convergence).
2. **Integration Tests**: Simulate fault scenarios across multiple subsystems.
3. **Hardware‑in‑the‑Loop (HIL)**: Validate real‑time response to injected faults.
4. **Simulation & Digital Twins**: Run thousands of Monte Carlo simulations with varied fault models.

### 8. Challenges & Future Directions

- **Scalability**: Managing FDI overhead in large, data‑intensive AV architectures.
- **False Positives/Negatives**: Balancing sensitivity vs specificity to avoid unnecessary safe mode activations.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Using anomaly detection models while ensuring explainability and verifiability.
- **Cyber‑Physical Security**: Distinguishing between faults induced by malicious attacks versus benign failures.
