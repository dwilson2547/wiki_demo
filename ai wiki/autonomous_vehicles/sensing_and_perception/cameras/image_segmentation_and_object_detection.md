# Image Segmentation & Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles  

Image segmentation and object detection are the two primary visual perception tasks that enable an autonomous vehicle to interpret its surroundings. While both rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), they differ in output granularity: detection yields bounding boxes, whereas segmentation provides pixel‑wise labels.

## 1. Object Detection  

### 1.1 Network Families  

| Family | Representative Models | Key Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **Single‑Shot Detectors** | YOLOv8, SSD | Fast inference (≈30–60 fps) with modest accuracy trade‑off. |
| **Two‑Stage Detectors** | Faster R-CNN, Cascade R‑CNN | Higher accuracy, especially for small or occluded objects; slower inference. |
| **Transformer‑based** | DETR, Deformable DETR | End‑to‑end attention mechanisms; improving speed/accuracy balance. |

### 1.2 Training Data  

- **Annotated datasets**: KITTI, Waymo Open Dataset, nuScenes, ApolloScape.  
- **Domain adaptation**: Synthetic data (CARLA, AirSim) to cover rare scenarios.  
- **Labeling strategies**: Semi‑automatic annotation with active learning loops.

### 1.3 Evaluation Metrics  

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **mAP@IoU = 0.5** | Mean Average Precision at Intersection over Union threshold of 0.5 (COCO metric). |
| **Precision/Recall curves** | Evaluate trade‑off between false positives and false negatives. |
| **Latency & FPS** | Real‑time performance constraints for on‑board inference. |

## 2. Image Segmentation  

### 2.1 Semantic vs Instance

- **Semantic segmentation** assigns a class label to each pixel (e.g., road, vehicle, pedestrian).  
- **Instance segmentation** distinguishes individual object instances within the same class (e.g., two cars).

### 2.2 Network Architectures  

| Architecture | Strengths |
|--------------|-----------|
| **U‑Net / DeepLabV3+** | Encoder–decoder structure; good for dense pixel prediction. |
| **Mask R‑CNN** | Combines detection and instance segmentation in a single pipeline. |
| **CondInst, SOLOv2** | Efficient instance segmentation with higher speed. |

### 2.3 Post‑Processing  

- **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)** for spatial refinement.  
- **Morphological operations** to clean up small noisy regions.  
- **Edge‑aware smoothing** to align predictions with lane markings.

## 3. Sensor Fusion  

Segmentation and detection outputs are fused with data from radar, Lidar, or ultrasonic sensors:

1. **Geometric Alignment** – Project camera pixels into the vehicle coordinate frame using calibration parameters.  
2. **Confidence Weighting** – Assign per‑pixel/box confidence scores; fuse via Bayesian inference.  
3. **Temporal Consistency** – Track objects across frames (Kalman filter, SORT) to mitigate detection jitter.

## 4. Deployment Considerations  

- **Model Compression**: TensorRT, ONNX Runtime with mixed precision.  
- **Hardware Acceleration**: GPUs (NVIDIA RTX series), FPGAs, or ASICs (Google Edge TPU).  
- **Real‑time Guarantees**: Use deterministic scheduling; prioritize critical classes (pedestrian, cyclist).  

## 5. Safety & Verification  

- **Functional Safety**: ISO 26262 Annex B for perception systems – hazard analysis, safety integrity levels (ASIL).  
- **Robustness Testing**: Adversarial examples, sensor noise injection, and scenario‑based simulation to validate detection reliability.  
- **Explainability**: Grad-CAM or SHAP visualizations to audit model decisions.
