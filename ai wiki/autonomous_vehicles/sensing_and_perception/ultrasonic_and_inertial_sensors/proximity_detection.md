**Proximity Detection in Autonomous Vehicles**

**Definition**  
Proximity detection refers to identifying nearby objects or obstacles using a combination of sensor modalities, primarily ultrasonic and inertial sensors, to prevent collisions during low‑speed maneuvers such as parking or lane changes.

**Key Functions**

1. **Obstacle Avoidance** – Real‑time distance measurement to trigger braking or steering adjustments.
2. **Lane Edge Detection** – Identifying curb lines or lane markings via side‑mounted ultrasonic arrays.
3. **Blind‑Spot Monitoring** – Continuous scanning of adjacent lanes for vehicles in the driver’s blind spots.

**Sensor Fusion Strategy**

- **Ultrasonic + IMU**: Ultrasonic provides absolute distance; IMU supplies vehicle velocity and acceleration to predict relative motion.
- **Kalman Filter**: Estimates relative position and velocity of obstacles by fusing ultrasonic range with vehicle state from IMU.
- **Event‑Driven Alerts**: Threshold crossing triggers audible/visual warnings.

**Algorithmic Workflow**

1. **Data Acquisition** – Sample ultrasonic sensors at 20 Hz; read IMU at 200 Hz.
2. **Preprocessing** – Apply median filtering to ultrasonic readings; calibrate IMU biases.
3. **State Prediction** – Use vehicle dynamics model to predict future positions over a short horizon (e.g., 1–2 s).
4. **Obstacle Tracking** – Associate new measurements with existing tracks via nearest‑neighbor or probabilistic data association.
5. **Risk Assessment** – Compute Time‑to‑Collision (TTC) and Distance‑to‑Impact (DTI); classify risk levels.
6. **Control Decision** – Generate braking/steering commands if TTC < threshold.

**Performance Metrics**

- **Detection Accuracy**: False positive/negative rates under varying lighting, weather, and surface conditions.
- **Latency**: End‑to‑end delay from sensor trigger to alert (<50 ms desirable).
- **Reliability**: Percentage of successful detections over long‑term operation (>99.5%).
