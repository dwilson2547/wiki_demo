# Sensor Fusion  

**Overview**  
Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple heterogeneous sensors—such as lidar, radar, cameras, ultrasonic transducers, and inertial measurement units (IMUs)—to produce a single, coherent representation of the vehicle’s surroundings. The goal is to mitigate individual sensor weaknesses (e.g., lidar’s limited range in adverse weather, camera’s sensitivity to lighting) and exploit complementary strengths, thereby improving perception accuracy, robustness, and reliability for autonomous driving.

**Key Objectives**

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Redundancy** | Multiple sensors provide overlapping information; failure of one does not cripple the system. |
| **Complementarity** | Different modalities capture distinct aspects (e.g., lidar gives precise depth, radar excels at velocity). |
| **Temporal Alignment** | Synchronize data streams to a common timestamp for accurate spatial correlation. |
| **Spatial Registration** | Transform all sensor data into a unified reference frame (usually vehicle‑centric). |
| **Uncertainty Management** | Quantify and propagate measurement uncertainty through the fusion pipeline. |

**Typical Fusion Pipeline**

1. **Pre‑processing** – Noise filtering, point‑cloud downsampling, image rectification.  
2. **Sensor Calibration & Registration** – Extrinsic (relative pose) and intrinsic calibration; use of factory‑calibrated parameters or online self‑calibration algorithms.  
3. **Feature Extraction** – Detect keypoints, edges, or semantic labels per modality.  
4. **Data Association / Matching** – Associate detections across sensors using spatial proximity, temporal consistency, or learned embeddings.  
5. **Fusion Layer** – Combine matched data via Bayesian filters (e.g., Kalman Filter, Particle Filter) or deep‑learning modules.  
6. **Post‑processing** – Track object states over time, estimate trajectories, and generate a final occupancy grid or semantic map.

**Common Challenges**

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategies |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Time Synchronization** | Hardware timestamping (e.g., PTP), software buffering with interpolation. |
| **Calibration Drift** | Periodic re‑calibration routines; use of feature‑based online calibration. |
| **Computational Load** | Parallel processing on GPUs/FPUs, hierarchical fusion (early vs late). |
| **Data Scarcity for ML Fusion** | Synthetic data generation, domain adaptation, transfer learning. |

**Future Directions**

- Integration of emerging sensors (e.g., solid‑state lidar, radar‑LiDAR fusion units).  
- Federated fusion across multiple vehicles to share high‑level semantic maps.  
- Explainable fusion frameworks that provide confidence metrics for downstream planners.
