# Bias Mitigation in Autonomous‑Vehicle Perception Models  

**Problem Statement**  
Machine‑learning models trained on biased data can exhibit unfair or unsafe behavior, especially when operating in diverse real‑world environments. This page outlines systematic strategies to detect, quantify, and mitigate bias throughout the AV development lifecycle.

## 1. Sources of Bias  

| Source | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Dataset imbalance** | Overrepresentation of sunny scenes vs. nighttime. |
| **Annotation artifacts** | Human annotators consistently label certain classes higher. |
| **Sensor limitations** | Lidar performance degrades in heavy rain, leading to under‑detection. |
| **Geographic distribution** | Data collected only from urban centers; rural scenarios missing. |

## 2. Bias Detection  

### 2.1 Statistical Metrics  
* **Demographic parity** – Equal detection rates across demographic groups (e.g., pedestrians of different ages).  
* **False‑negative/positive rates per class** – Compute confusion matrices stratified by scene type.  
* **Coverage metrics** – Percentage of scenes where each sensor modality is usable.

### 2.2 Visual Analytics  
* **Heatmaps of prediction confidence** across geographic maps.  
* **Per‑class ROC curves** for different weather conditions.  

### 2.3 Auditing Tools  
| Tool | Focus |
|------|-------|
| `Aequitas` (IBM) | Fairness metrics in classification. |
| `Fairlearn` | Mitigation algorithms, metric tracking. |
| `Pandas Profiling` | Data distribution summaries. |

## 3. Mitigation Strategies  

### 3.1 Dataset‑Level Techniques  
* **Resampling** – Oversample minority classes; undersample majority classes.  
* **Synthetic data generation** – Use GANs or simulation (CARLA, LGSVL) to create diverse scenarios.  
* **Domain randomization** – Vary lighting, weather, and textures in synthetic scenes to improve robustness.

### 3.2 Algorithm‑Level Techniques  

| Technique | How it Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Reweighting** | Assign higher loss weights to under‑represented samples. |
| **Adversarial debiasing** | Train a discriminator to predict protected attributes; encourage the feature extractor to be invariant. |
| **Fairness constraints** | Add penalty terms enforcing equalized odds or demographic parity during training. |

### 3.3 Post‑processing Adjustments  

* **Calibration curves per group** – Adjust decision thresholds so that true positive rates are aligned.  
* **Confidence thresholding** – Dynamically change confidence cutoffs based on environmental conditions.

## 4. Continuous Bias Monitoring  

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Deployment | Collect runtime statistics; flag anomalous detection patterns. |
| Feedback Loop | Incorporate human‑in‑the‑loop corrections into the dataset. |
| Model Retraining | Schedule periodic retrainings with updated, balanced data. |

---

## 5. Ethical and Legal Considerations  

* **Transparency** – Publish bias reports alongside model releases (e.g., ML‑Model Card).  
* **Regulatory compliance** – Align with emerging AI ethics guidelines (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF).  
* **Stakeholder engagement** – Involve community groups in reviewing dataset representativeness.

## 6. Toolchain Integration  

| Component | Suggested Library |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Data preprocessing | `pandas`, `scikit-learn` (sampling utilities) |
| Model training | `PyTorch Lightning` with custom loss functions |
| Fairness evaluation | `Fairlearn`, `Aequitas` |
| Continuous integration | GitHub Actions with bias‑check scripts |
