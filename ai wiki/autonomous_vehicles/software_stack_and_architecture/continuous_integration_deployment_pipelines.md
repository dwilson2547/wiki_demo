# Continuous Integration & Deployment Pipelines for Autonomous Vehicles  

CI/CD pipelines automate building, testing, and deploying AV software across heterogeneous hardware platforms while maintaining safety integrity. The pipeline typically comprises **source control**, **build automation**, **static analysis**, **simulation** (digital twins), **hardware‑in‑the‑loop (HIL)** testing, and **over‑the‑air (OTA) delivery**.

## 1. Source Control & Branching Strategies  

- **Git LFS**: Manage large binary assets (HD maps, trained models).  
- **Feature Branches + Pull Requests**: Enforce code review for every change.  
- **Release Branches**: Tagged with ASIL levels; undergo extensive testing before merging into `main`.

## 2. Build Automation  

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| CMake / Meson | Cross‑platform build configuration. |
| Bazel | Incremental builds for large monorepos. |
| Jenkins / GitLab CI | Orchestrate pipelines; support parallel job execution. |

### Artifact Management  
- Store binaries in **JFrog Artifactory** or **Sonatype Nexus** with immutable tags.  
- Include metadata: build time, compiler flags, ASIL level.

## 3. Static Analysis & Formal Verification  

| Tool | Target |
|------|--------|
| Polyspace / CodeSonar | Detect runtime errors, memory leaks, and logic faults. |
| Coq / Isabelle | Prove properties of critical algorithms (e.g., collision avoidance). |
| SafeRTOS + MISRA Compliance Checks | Ensure adherence to coding standards. |

## 4. Simulation & Digital Twins  

- **CARLA / LGSVL**: Open‑source driving simulators for perception and planning validation.  
- **PreScan / dSPACE SCALEXIO**: Hardware-in-the-loop platforms that emulate vehicle dynamics.  
- **Scenario Generation**: Use tools like `OpenSCENARIO` to create diverse traffic, weather, and lighting conditions.

## 5. Safety‑Critical Testing  

1. **Unit & Integration Tests**  
   - Coverage thresholds (>90 %) for critical modules.  
2. **Regression Tests**  
   - Re-run previous test suites after every merge.  
3. **Fault Injection**  
   - Simulate sensor dropout, communication loss to verify fault‑tolerance mechanisms.  

## 6. Over‑the‑Air (OTA) Delivery  

- **Secure Boot & Firmware Validation**: Use cryptographic signatures and nonce-based challenge–response protocols.  
- **Delta Updates**: Only transmit changed binaries to reduce bandwidth.  
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Store previous stable firmware image; revert if update fails.

## 7. Compliance & Documentation  

- Generate **Test Reports** compliant with ISO 26262 Part 6 (Safety Validation).  
- Maintain **Change Control Logs** detailing every modification, reviewer, and test outcome.
