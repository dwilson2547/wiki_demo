## 1️⃣ Fundamentals

### 1a) What is a Network?
**Definition:**  
A *network* is any collection of interconnected devices that can exchange data. The purpose ranges from local file sharing to global communication across continents.

**Key Points**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Data transfer, resource sharing, control, collaboration |
| **Scope** | From a single LAN to the entire Internet |
| **Components** | Nodes (hosts, routers), links (cables, wireless), protocols |

**Common Types**

| Type | Typical Size | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| PAN | < 10 m | Bluetooth devices |
| LAN | < 100 km | Office Wi‑Fi |
| MAN | 1–20 km | City‑wide fiber network |
| WAN | > 20 km | ISP backbone, Internet |

**FAQ**

- *Is the Internet a single network?*  
  It’s an interconnection of many autonomous networks—an “inter‑network” rather than a monolithic entity.

---

### 1b) Physical Layer Basics
**Definition:**  
The lowest OSI layer that deals with raw bit transmission over physical media.

**Key Points**

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Media Types** | Copper (Ethernet), fiber (optical), wireless (RF, IR) |
| **Modulation** | AM, FM, QAM, OFDM |
| **Encoding Schemes** | Manchester, 4B/5B, 8B/10B |

| **Repeaters** | Regenerate signals over long distances |

**Tools & Standards**

- IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), IEEE 802.11 (Wi‑Fi)
- CAT5e/CAT6 cables, SFP modules

**FAQ**

- *Why does fiber have lower attenuation than copper?*  
  Optical signals can travel longer without loss because photons are less affected by electrical noise.

---

### 1c) Data Representation
**Definition:**  
The method by which information is encoded into bits and transmitted over a network.

**Key Points**

| Layer | Representation |
|-------|----------------|
| Bits → Bytes | 8 bits per byte |
| Frame | Header, payload, trailer |
| Error Detection | Parity bit, CRC‑32 |
| Clock Sync | Synchronous/asynchronous transmission |

**Common Algorithms**

- CRC‑16/CRC‑32 for Ethernet
- Hamming code for error correction in storage

**FAQ**

- *What’s the difference between parity and CRC?*  
  Parity checks a single bit; CRC provides far stronger error detection by treating data as polynomial coefficients.

---

### 1d) Network Topologies
**Definition:**  
Physical or logical arrangement of nodes and links.

| Topology | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Bus | All devices share a single cable | Simple, cheap | Single point of failure |

| Mesh | Every node links to many others | High redundancy | Complex, expensive |
| Hybrid | Combination (e.g., star‑mesh) | Customizable | Complexity scales |

**Use‑Case Examples**

- Data center: Full mesh or spine‑leaf
- Home Wi‑Fi: Star via router

**FAQ**

- *Can a network have multiple topologies simultaneously?*  
  Yes—logical topologies can differ from physical ones (e.g., a bus of cables forming a logical star).

---

## 2️⃣ Core Layered Models

### 2a) OSI Reference Model
**Definition:**  
A conceptual framework that separates networking functions into seven distinct layers.

| Layer | Primary Functions |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 Physical | Bit transmission, cabling |
| 2 Data Link | MAC, framing, error detection |
| 3 Network | Logical addressing (IP), routing |
| 4 Transport | End‑to‑end reliability, flow control |
| 5 Session | Connection establishment, dialog management |
| 6 Presentation | Encryption, compression, data translation |
| 7 Application | High‑level protocols (HTTP, SMTP) |

**Key Concepts**

- **Encapsulation:** Each layer adds its own header/footer.
- **Interoperability:** Protocols at each layer must conform to the standard.

**FAQ**

- *Is OSI used in practice?*  
  Mostly for education; real networks follow the TCP/IP model, but OSI helps reason about functions.

---

### 2b) TCP/IP Model
**Definition:**  
The pragmatic four‑layer stack that underlies the Internet.

| Layer | Functions |
|-------|-----------|
| Link | Physical & data link (Ethernet, Wi‑Fi) |
| Internet | Routing, IP addressing |
| Transport | Reliable delivery (TCP), datagrams (UDP) |
| Application | Services (HTTP, DNS, SMTP) |

**Mapping to OSI**

- **Link → Layers 1–2**
- **Internet → Layer 3**
- **Transport → Layer 4**
- **Application → Layers 5‑7**

**FAQ**

- *Why does TCP/IP have fewer layers?*  
  It merges several OSI layers for simplicity and because many functions are handled by a single protocol (e.g., IP includes both addressing and routing).

---

### 2c) Layer Interactions & Encapsulation
**Definition:**  
Process of wrapping data with headers/trailers as it moves down the stack.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Application → Transport | Adds TCP/UDP header |
| Transport → Internet | Adds IP header |
| Internet → Link | Adds Ethernet/Wi‑Fi frame header |

**Key Points**

- **End‑to‑end vs. hop‑by‑hop**: Only the transport layer cares about end‑to‑end reliability.
- **Protocol Independence**: Each layer can change without affecting others.

**FAQ**

- *Can a packet skip layers?*  
  Not in the standard stack; however, tunneling protocols (e.g., VPN) encapsulate packets inside another protocol’s headers, effectively adding an extra “layer”.

---

## 3️⃣ Data‑Link & Network Protocols

### 3a) Ethernet & Wi‑Fi (802.11)
**Definition:**  
Dominant LAN technologies for wired and wireless networks.

| Feature | Ethernet | Wi‑Fi |

- **QoS**: Priority Queuing (IEEE 802.1p).

**FAQ**

- *What’s the difference between CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA?*  
  Collision detection (CD) works on wired media; collision avoidance (CA) is needed for wireless where devices cannot detect collisions.

---

### 3b) Switching & Routing Fundamentals
**Definition:**  
Switches forward frames locally; routers forward packets across networks.

| Device | Primary Function |
|--------|------------------|
| Switch | MAC table lookup, frame forwarding |
| Router | IP routing table lookup, packet forwarding |

**Key Concepts**

- **Static vs. Dynamic Routing**: RIP (distance‑vector), OSPF (link‑state).
- **BGP**: Inter‑AS routing on the Internet.

**FAQ**

- *Does a switch need an IP address?*  
  For management purposes; data switching is performed at layer 2 without needing IP.

---

### 3c) IP Addressing & Subnetting
**Definition:**  
Logical addressing scheme for identifying hosts and networks.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| IPv4 | 192.168.1.0/24 |
| IPv6 | 2001:db8::/32 |

**Key Points**

- **CIDR**: Classless Inter‑Domain Routing → flexible subnet masks.
- **VLSM**: Variable Length Subnet Masking for efficient address use.

**NAT / PAT**

- Translating private to public addresses (Network Address Translation).
- Port‑Address Translation (PAT) allows multiple devices behind a single IP.

**FAQ**

| Reliability | Sequence numbers, acknowledgments |

**Key Points**

- **Retransmission Timeout (RTO)**: Adaptive timers.
- **TCP Options**: Nagle’s algorithm, timestamps.

**FAQ**

- *What is “head‑of‑line blocking”?*  
  If a packet in the head of a queue gets lost, all subsequent packets must wait until it’s retransmitted.

## 1️⃣ Fundamentals  
### a) What is a Network?

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Definition** | A *network* is any collection of interconnected computing devices (nodes) that can exchange data, resources, or services. The term usually implies some form of *communication*—wired, wireless, or optical—using standardized protocols to ensure interoperability. |
| **Purpose & Scope** | • Share files, printers, and storage.<br>• Provide access to the Internet or intranet services.<br>• Enable distributed computing (e.g., cloud, edge).<br>• Support real‑time communication (VoIP, video conferencing). |
| **Basic Architecture** | Networks are often described by three layers:<br>1. *Access* – physical connections and link‑layer protocols (Ethernet, Wi‑Fi).<br>2. *Core* – routing & switching infrastructure that forwards packets.<br>3. *Application* – services built on top of transport (HTTP, SMTP, etc.). |
| **Key Terms** | • **Node** – any device capable of sending/receiving data (PC, router, server).<br>• **Link** – the physical or logical connection between nodes.<br>• **Topology** – arrangement of links (bus, star, mesh).<br>• **Protocol** – a set of rules governing communication. |
| **Types of Networks** | 1. *Local Area Network* (LAN) – confined to a building or campus.<br>2. *Wide Area Network* (WAN) – spans cities, countries, or continents.<br>3. *Personal Area Network* (PAN) – personal devices within ~10 m (Bluetooth).<br>4. *Metropolitan Area Network* (MAN) – city‑wide.<br>5. *Wireless Sensor/IoT Networks* – low‑power, often mesh. |
| **Common Misconceptions** | • “All networks are wired.” – Wireless technologies now dominate many use cases.<br>• “A network is only a physical cable.” – Protocols and logical topologies matter just as much. |
| **Real‑World Example** | A typical office LAN: 10 GbE switches connect workstations to a core router, which in turn connects to the Internet via a broadband link (fiber or DSL). |
| **See Also** | • OSI Reference Model<br>• TCP/IP Model<br>• Ethernet & Wi‑Fi Basics |

   ↓ (IP Header)
Network Packet
   ↓ (MAC Header)
Link Frame
   ↓ (Physical bits)
```

*Pitfall:* Assuming changes at one layer propagate automatically to all others—protocols often enforce strict encapsulation boundaries.

## 1️⃣ Fundamentals

### What is a Network?
A network is a collection of two or more interconnected devices that can exchange data. Networks enable resource sharing (files, printers, Internet access) and communication across geographic distances.

**Key terms:** *Nodes*, *links*, *topology*, *protocols*  
**Use‑case:** A home Wi‑Fi router connects laptops to the Internet.  
**Pitfall:** Assuming all networks are wired; many today are wireless or hybrid.

### Physical Layer Basics
The lowest layer of networking that deals with the actual transmission medium and electrical/optical signals.

- **Media types**: copper (Ethernet), fiber optics, radio waves.  
- **Encoding**: Manchester, 4B/5B, NRZ.  
- **Repeaters & extenders**: amplify or regenerate signals.

**Use‑case:** Extending Ethernet over 100 m with a repeater; using SFP+ modules for 10 GbE fiber.  
**Pitfall:** Ignoring attenuation and crosstalk in long runs.

### Data Representation
How information is turned into bits, bytes, frames, and error‑checked.

- **Frames**: encapsulate payload + header (e.g., Ethernet frame).  
- **Error detection**: parity, CRC‑32.  
- **Clock sync**: 10/100 Mbps Ethernet uses 125 MHz clocks; Wi‑Fi uses OFDM subcarriers.

**Use‑case:** A corrupted packet is detected by a CRC and discarded.  
**Pitfall:** Believing error correction (FEC) is universal—many protocols only detect, not correct.

### Network Topologies
Physical or logical layouts of nodes and links.

| Topology | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Bus | All devices share a single cable. | Simple & cheap | Single point of failure; limited bandwidth |
| Star | Devices connect to a central hub/switch. | Easy to isolate faults | Hub is a single point of failure |
| Ring | Each node connects to two neighbors forming a loop. | Predictable latency | Failure breaks the ring |
| Mesh | Full or partial inter‑connectivity. | High redundancy | Complexity & cost |
| Hybrid | Combination of the above. | Tailored to needs | Can be hard to design |

**Use‑case:** Ethernet LANs are typically star or switched star.  
**Pitfall:** Thinking mesh is always better; it can create broadcast storms if not managed.

---

## 2️⃣ Core Layered Models

### OSI Reference Model
Seven conceptual layers that standardize networking functions.

| Layer | Responsibility | Example Protocols |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 Physical | Transmission of raw bits | Ethernet, Wi‑Fi PHY |
| 2 Data Link | Frame delimitation & MAC addressing | Ethernet II, PPP |
| 3 Network | Logical addressing & routing | IP, ICMP |
| 4 Transport | End‑to‑end reliability | TCP, UDP |
| 5 Session | Control dialogues between applications | RPC, SMB |
| 6 Presentation | Data format translation & encryption | TLS, JPEG |
| 7 Application | High‑level services | HTTP, SMTP |

**Use‑case:** Understanding why a packet travels through each layer helps debug protocol mismatches.  
**Pitfall:** Treating OSI as an implementation stack; in practice protocols span multiple layers.

### TCP/IP Model
A pragmatic four‑layer model used by the Internet.

| Layer | Responsibility | Typical Protocols |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Link | Data link & physical | Ethernet, Wi‑Fi, PPP |
| Internet | Logical addressing & routing | IP, ICMP, ARP |
| Transport | End‑to‑end data transfer | TCP, UDP |
| Application | User services | HTTP, FTP, SMTP |

**Use‑case:** When configuring a firewall rule, you usually reference the transport layer (TCP port 80).  
**Pitfall:** Confusing “Internet” with the entire Internet; it’s just the network layer.

### Layer Interactions & Encapsulation
Each higher layer adds its own header to the payload passed down. Decapsulation happens in reverse order at the destination.

- **Encapsulation example**: Application data → TCP header → IP header → Ethernet frame.
- **Decapsulation**: Ethernet → IP → TCP → application.

---

## 3️⃣ Data‑Link & Network Protocols

### Ethernet & Wi‑Fi (802.11)
The dominant LAN technologies.

| Feature | Ethernet | Wi‑Fi |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Media | Copper/fiber | RF (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz) |
| MAC protocol | CSMA/CD | CSMA/CA + ACKs |
| Data rate | 10–100 Gbps | 1–9 Gbps (802.11ax) |
| Topology | Star (switch) | Mesh or star (AP) |

**Use‑case:** A corporate LAN uses gigabit Ethernet switches; a home network uses an 802.11ac router.  
**Pitfall:** Believing CSMA/CD still applies to modern Ethernet—full‑duplex removes collisions.

### Switching & Routing Fundamentals
- **Switches** forward frames based on MAC tables (Layer 2).  
- **Routers** forward packets based on IP routes (Layer 3).  

Static routing: manually configured paths.  
Dynamic routing protocols: RIP, OSPF (internal), BGP (inter‑AS).

**Use‑case:** A campus router runs OSPF to distribute routes among departmental switches.  
**Pitfall:** Assuming a switch can route IPv4; only Layer 3 capable devices do.

### IP Addressing & Subnetting
- **IPv4**: 32‑bit address, classful vs CIDR.  
- **Subnet mask** defines network vs host bits.  
- **CIDR notation** /24, /16, etc.

Example: `192.168.1.0/24` → 256 addresses (254 usable).  

**Use‑case:** Designing a subnet for a small office: `10.0.0.0/28`.  
**Pitfall:** Overlapping subnets; leads to routing loops.

### ICMP, ARP, Neighbor Discovery
- **ICMP**: Control messages (ping, traceroute).  
- **ARP**: Resolves IPv4 → MAC.  
- **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)**: Resolves IPv6 → MAC.

**Use‑case:** `ping 8.8.8.8` uses ICMP echo request/reply.  
**Pitfall:** Assuming ARP is always safe; spoofed ARP can hijack traffic.

---

## 4️⃣ Transport Layer Deep‑Dive

### TCP Mechanics
- **Three‑way handshake**: SYN → SYN‑ACK → ACK.  
- **Congestion control**: Slow start, congestion avoidance (Cubic).  
- **Flow control**: Sliding window, advertised window size.

**Use‑case:** Streaming video uses TCP for reliable delivery; the buffer adjusts to network conditions.  
**Pitfall:** Thinking “TCP is always slow”; modern implementations mitigate latency.

### UDP & QUIC
- **UDP**: Connectionless, no ACKs, minimal header (8 B).  
- **QUIC**: Built on UDP, adds multiplexing, 0‑RTT handshakes, built‑in TLS 1.3.

**Use‑case:** Voice over IP uses UDP; HTTP/2+QUIC runs on port 443 over UDP.  
**Pitfall:** Believing QUIC is just “faster HTTPS”; it’s a separate protocol stack.

### Multiplexing (Ports, Sockets)
- **Port numbers** (0–65535) distinguish services.  
- **Socket**: IP + port pair; used by OS for process communication.

**Use‑case:** A web server listens on TCP 80/443; an SSH daemon on TCP 22.  
**Pitfall:** Port conflicts; two services cannot bind to the same port on one interface.

---

## 5️⃣ Application Layer & Service Protocols

### HTTP/HTTPS & REST APIs
- **HTTP**: Stateless request‑response (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  
- **HTTPS**: TLS over TCP (port 443).  
- **REST**: Resource‑oriented design; uses standard verbs.

**Use‑case:** A mobile app fetches JSON from `https://api.example.com/users`.  
**Pitfall:** Not closing connections in HTTP/1.1 can exhaust sockets (use keep‑alive).

### SMTP, POP3, IMAP
- **SMTP**: Sending email (port 25, 587).  
- **POP3**: Downloading mail (port 110).  
- **IMAP**: Synchronizing mail across devices (port 143).

**Use‑case:** A corporate email server uses IMAP for mobile clients.  
**Pitfall:** Assuming POP3 preserves messages; it deletes by default.

### DNS & DHTs
- **DNS**: Name → IP mapping via recursive or iterative queries.  
- **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)**: Peer‑to‑peer key‑value store (used in BitTorrent, IPFS).

**Use‑case:** Browsing `www.google.com` triggers a series of DNS lookups.  
**Pitfall:** Overlooking DNSSEC; without it, responses can be spoofed.

### FTP/SFTP/FTPS
- **FTP**: Plaintext transfer; separate control/data channels.  
- **SFTP**: SSH‑based file transfer (single encrypted channel).  
- **FTPS**: FTP over TLS/SSL.

**Use‑case:** Backing up logs to an SFTP server for security compliance.  
**Pitfall:** FTP’s default port 21 is blocked in many firewalls; use passive mode or FTPS instead.

### VPN protocols (IPSec, OpenVPN, WireGuard)
- **IPSec**: Layer 3Need concise wiki-style pages for each node. Provide sections: overview, key concepts, protocols, examples. Due to length constraints maybe summarize major nodes.Below is a **wiki‑style write‑up** for every concept in the tree above.  
Each entry follows a consistent format:

## 2️⃣ Core Layered Models

### 2a) OSI Reference Model (7 layers)

**Overview**  
The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication system into seven distinct layers.

| Layer | Acronym | Main Function |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Physical | Electrical/optical signals |
| 2 | Data Link | Framing, MAC addressing, error detection |
| 3 | Network | Logical addressing (IP), routing |
| 4 | Transport | End‑to‑end reliability, flow control |
| 5 | Session | Establishing, managing sessions |
| 6 | Presentation | Encryption, compression, data formatting |
| 7 | Application | User‑oriented services |

**Key Concepts & Terminology**

### 2b) TCP/IP Model (4 layers)

**Overview**  
The Internet’s reference model simplifies OSI into four layers, matching the suite of protocols that actually run on the network.

| Layer | Acronym | Main Function |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| Link | Physical + Data Link | Media access and framing |
| Internet | Network | IP routing |
| Transport | TCP/UDP | End‑to‑end reliability |
| Application | Applications | User services (HTTP, SMTP, etc.) |

**Key Concepts & Terminology**

- *Internet Layer*: IPv4/IPv6, fragmentation, ICMP error messages.
- *Transport Layer*: TCP sequence numbers, congestion windows; UDP is connectionless.

**Common Use‑Cases / Applications**

- The entire Internet runs on the TCP/IP model. All modern OSes implement it in their kernel networking stack.

**Related Topics / Further Reading**  
[OSI Reference Model](/networking/osi-model), [Layer Interactions](/networking/layer-interactions)

---

### 2c) Layer Interactions & Encapsulation

**Overview**  
Encapsulation ensures that each layer can function independently. When data travels from source to destination, it is wrapped with headers at each layer.

**Key Concepts**

- **Stacking**: Higher layers rely on lower layers for delivery.
- **Decapsulation**: Removal of headers in reverse order at the receiver.

**Technical Details**  
Example: A HTTP GET request (Application) → TCP header (Transport) → IP header (Internet) → Ethernet frame (Link). The receiving host strips Ethernet, then IP, then TCP before passing data to the web browser.

**Common Use‑Cases / Applications**

- Troubleshooting often involves inspecting packets at a specific layer (e.g., Wireshark captures show Ethernet, IP, TCP headers).

## 1️⃣ Fundamentals

### 1a) What is a Network?
A **computer network** is an interconnected set of devices that can exchange data and resources. Networks enable communication between computers, servers, mobile devices, sensors, etc., by using shared or dedicated media (copper cabling, fiber optics, radio waves). Key purposes include resource sharing, data distribution, remote access, and real‑time collaboration.

### 1b) Physical Layer Basics
The **physical layer** (Layer 1 of the OSI model) defines how bits are transmitted over a physical medium. It specifies:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Media** | Copper cables (Ethernet), fiber optics, wireless spectrum. |
| **Modulation & Encoding** | Techniques such as NRZ, Manchester, QAM to map data onto signals. |
| **Transceivers** | Devices that convert digital data into analog signals and vice versa. |
| **Repeaters & Hubs** | Regenerate or repeat signals over long distances. |

### 1c) Data Representation
Data on a network is ultimately represented as binary digits (bits). These are grouped into bytes, then framed for transmission. Error detection mechanisms—parity bits, CRCs—ensure integrity. Clock synchronization keeps sender and receiver in step.

### 1d) Network Topologies
Common physical topologies:

| Topology | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Bus** | Single cable with devices attached via taps. | Simple, inexpensive. | Bottleneck; one fault can collapse network. |
| **Star** | Central hub/switch; all nodes connect to it. | Easy to manage; single point of failure isolated. | Requires more cabling. |
| **Ring** | Each node connects to two neighbors forming a closed loop. | Deterministic bandwidth. | Failure of one link breaks the ring unless redundancy is added. |
| **Mesh** | Every node may connect to many others. | High resilience, optimal routing. | Complex and costly to implement. |

## 2️⃣ Core Layered Models

### 2a) OSI Reference Model
The **OSI model** divides networking functions into seven conceptual layers:

1. **Physical** – electrical/optical signals.
2. **Data Link** – framing, MAC addresses, error control.
3. **Network** – logical addressing (IP), routing.
4. **Transport** – reliable delivery (TCP) or best‑effort (UDP).
5. **Session** – opening, closing, maintaining sessions.
6. **Presentation** – data translation, encryption, compression.
7. **Application** – end‑user protocols (HTTP, SMTP).

Each layer communicates only with its adjacent layers via well‑defined interfaces.

### 2b) TCP/IP Model
A pragmatic four‑layer model used in the Internet:

1. **Link** – Ethernet, Wi‑Fi, PPP.
2. **Internet** – IP routing, ICMP.
3. **Transport** – TCP/UDP.
4. **Application** – HTTP, SMTP, DNS.

The TCP/IP stack is what most modern OSes implement directly.

### 2c) Layer Interactions & Encapsulation
When data moves from the application downwards, each layer adds its own header (encapsulation). Conversely, on reception, layers peel off headers in reverse order (decapsulation).

| **Purpose** | Enables resource sharing (files, printers), communication (email, chat), and distributed processing. |
| **Key properties** | *Scalability*, *Reliability*, *Security*, *Performance*. |

#### How it fits
- The starting point for all other concepts; every layer above depends on a working network.

#### Real‑world examples
- Home Wi‑Fi (LAN) → Internet (WAN) → Cloud services.

#### Further reading
- “Computer Networks” by Tanenbaum & Wetherall – Chapters 1–2.  

---

- The lowest OSI layer; all higher layers assume a reliable bit stream.

#### Real‑world examples
- 100 Mbps Ethernet over twisted pair vs 10 Gbps fiber link.

#### Common pitfalls
- **Signal attenuation**: Over long copper runs, use repeaters or switch to fiber.  
- **Impedance mismatch**: Can cause reflections and data loss.

---

### 1.3 Data Representation

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Bits → Bytes → Frames** | A bit is the most basic unit; a byte groups eight bits; frames are the smallest logical unit on the link layer. |
| **Error detection** | Parity, CRC‑32 (used in Ethernet). |
| **Clock synchronization** | Master–slave clocks or Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE). |

#### How it fits
- Provides the groundwork for framing and error handling in the Data Link layer.

*Encapsulation*: Each upper layer adds its header to a packet before handing it down.  
*Decapsulation*: Reverse process at the receiver.

#### Real‑world example
- A TCP segment → IP datagram → Ethernet frame.

#### Troubleshooting tip
- Use `tcpdump` or Wireshark: Inspect headers from top to bottom; mismatched ports often mean wrong protocol.
